THE VISITOR CENTRE
The Visitor Center of the Montevecchia and Curone Valley Park, active and inaugurated in 2007, consists of two parts, one internal and one external. The aim is to inform users of everything that the territory can offer. The structure was built to allow you to grasp the main elements of interest of the territory of the Montevecchia and Curone Valley Park and to learn about hidden aspects that are difficult to see for visitors. It therefore represents an invitation to discover the territory in a more careful and conscious way. If the Visitor Centre is open, enter and explore through the senses: tactile, olfactory and sound installations will guide the visitor to experience emotions and sensations linked to this territory.
To reach the bathrooms: from the entrance of the visitor center, on the left for those who enter and on the right for those who leave, you must follow the wall of the building for about 20 meters, at the corner continue to the right for about three meters.
Pay attention to the step at the entrance of the bathrooms.
Inside the room, you will find 2 doors on the right and 2 doors on the left to access the bathrooms. At the bottom of the room, in the center, you will find the sink.

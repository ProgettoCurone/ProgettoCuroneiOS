THE PERFUME GARDEN
Among the most known and appreciated plants, the ones that are important to remember are the medical herbs, considered rightly or wrongly useful in the treatment of some disorders, traumas and diseases.
Today, medical herbs are little known because they are no longer considered essential, even if some of them, the aromatic, are still used. In the kitchen they are still important: so it is for rosemary that, for centuries, has been cultivated on the terraces of these hills so as to become a symbol of the Park.
The perfume garden is a magical corner where you can perceive very intense smells, It is possible to recognize the various essences, rediscover familiar scents or, perhaps, learn to recognize new ones.
In this corner, there are plants belonging to different botanical groups such as umbelliferae with umbrella-shaped inflorescence or mugworts, that have leaves with a very complex shape. The labiate instead do not have a cylindrical stem but quadrangular ... You can try to touch one of them. If we stop to listen in the Perfume Garden during the flowering period, we could hear how many bees and other pollinating insects are attracted by the nectar of these plants. The flowers that they present are small, sometimes tiny, but very appreciated by these small and very useful insects.

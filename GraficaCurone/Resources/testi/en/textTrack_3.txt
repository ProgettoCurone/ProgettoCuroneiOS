THE BIRDS
Birds are the animals most present in the Park by number of species. They have a very sharp eyesight so, to be able to see and hear them, some precautions are necessary, such as the barrier of reeds equipped with loopholes. This installation is intended to hide the observer from the acute sight of these animals. Attracted by the presence of food placed in feeders in the winter season, birds feel quite safe behind this wooden structure, because they can't hear or see anyone.
What do birds eat? During the summer, the feeders are not provided with food but, when the first cold arrives until the beginning of spring, they are filled with an abundant variety of seeds mixed with sweet and food waste, to ensure the energy meal that the birds need.
The feeders are located about 10 meters beyond this station, positioned between the plants, in front of the barrier of reeds. A path divides the visitors'area from the feeders.
Be careful when you approach the feeders because the land is terraced, there is no parapet and the presence of plants and shrubs make the area a little impervious.   
To enter the structure of reeds on your left, you must open the curtain that closes the entrance.
You can stop silently behind the barrier and wait patiently: you can learn to recognize, through the different chirps, the most common species in our garden.

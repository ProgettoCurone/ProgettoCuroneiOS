THE GARDEN
A nice and useful way to help small animals survive is to provide them with shelter or food. When these actions are implemented in places where fauna is damaged or in danger, real environmental protection actions are carried out. Based on this, providing shelter to animals is certainly a protection action and the food in the gardens attract them. Vegetables and small fruits, selected to attract reptiles and mammals that feed on them, or insects and other invertebrates that attract birds, have been planted in the boxes. An example can be represented by the strawberry (Fragaria vesca), much appreciated by animals because it is a perennial plant, it is there in every period of the year.
In the garden it is possible, by touching, to understand if the plant is young or ready for harvesting the vegetable. You can also understand the difference between various leaves or you can check the presence of flowers (example artichoke flower). You can explore to find out what vegetables are present in the garden this season.
If you do not collect these plants but you leave them to the animals, you will allow them to get used to the idea of always being able to find food here: in this way, they will learn the way and they could come back to visit us ... And maybe, if you are lucky, you can meet one of these animals too. Near the garden there are also piles of wood, they are hybernacula. They have not been forgotten there, they are deliberately placed there to accommodate small animals looking for a shelter, a nest or a den. Walking through the woods, you may find others. Now you know what they are for, please do not destroy them!
